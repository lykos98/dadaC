/*
 * 
 * This toy utility converts a binary data file into an equivalentascii file
 *
 * -- Each row correspond to a particle; the meaning of the columsn is as follows:
 * column 1     : the unique ID of the particle
 * column 2     : the type of the particle (see below)
 * column 3     : the ID of the fof to which the particle belongs
 * column 4     : the ID of the subhalo to which the particle belongs
 * column 5,6,7 : the spatial position of the particle
 * column 8     : the kinetic energy of the particle
 * column 9     : the potential energy of the particle 
 *
 * -- particle types:
 * 0     : gas particles
 * 1,2,3 : dark matter (there will be only type 1
 * 4     : stars
 * 5     : black holes
 *
 * -- meaning of the subhalo IDs:
 *
 * positive values, i.e. [1, ...] ==> a gravitationally bounded subhalo, i.e. "a galaxy"
 * 0 (zero)                       ==> particles gravitationally bound to the FOF that are not
 *                                    bound to a subhalo ("diffuse" particles)
 * -1                             ==> "fuzzy" particles: they have been included by the fof
 *                                    algorithm because of gemoetrical reasons but are not
 *                                    bound to the FOF (nor to any subhalos)
